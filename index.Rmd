Here you find the coding material for the workshop on **reinforcement learning and sequential sampling modeling**, presented at [CMAH](https://cmah.eu/) 2021 (9 and 10 Sept 2021).

## Program:

* Sequential sampling
  1. Diffusion model
  2. Race diffusion model

* Combining RL with sequential sampling
	1. RL + Diffusion model

* Examples
  1. Fitting the RLDM on Fontanesi and colleagues (2019) data with hierarchical Bayesian estimation
  2. Fitting the DM on Ratcliff and Rouder (1998) data with MLE (group activity)

## Before starting

Check the installation of the following packages:
```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
require(tidyverse)
require(dfoptim)
require(rtdists)
require(rstan)
require(bayesplot)
```

And download the `rwald code.r` at [this OSF page](https://osf.io/3sp9t/), that was attached to the [Tillman paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32424622/) on the race diffusion model.
